# Stack

Stack has a good <a href="http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> about the installation process on different platforms that you can refer to learn to install it on your computer.

# Creating the project

We first need to install yesod-bin and cabal:

~~~
stack install yesod-bin-1.4.16.1 cabal-install
~~~

Then, we initialize the project:

~~~
stack exec yesod init
~~~

Yesod will ask a few questions about the project. Here are the answers:

~~~
Project name: flora
Database option: p
~~~

And create the **stack.yaml** file:

~~~
cd flora
stack init
~~~

At last we need to get the project dependencies and, just to be safe,
rebuild yesod-bin with the current GHC:

~~~
stack build yesod-bin-1.4.16.1 .
~~~

And now we are good to run the project:

~~~
stack exec yesod devel
~~~

Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>
and you should see the following page:
