Flora Time Tracker is a pet project I use to study new stacks and to test new architectural concepts.

I built the first version to study how to write, organize and integrate a web application built with <a href="http://liftweb.net/" target="_blank">Lift</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://www.requirejs.org/" target="_blank">require.js</a>

The purpose of this version is to build a time tracker that is able to:

 * track the time spent on tasks of different projects
 * plot charts.
 * own an account is not mandatory.
 * manage projects.
 * create accounts with Google+ or Github IDs or by providing an e-mail and password.

And to use the following stack and tools:

 * <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank">Haskell</a>
 * <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/" target="_blank">Yesod</a>
 * <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack#readme" target="_blank">Stack</a>
 * <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgres</a>
 * <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>
 * <a href="http://rackt.org/redux/" target="_blank">Redux</a>
 * <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>
 * <a href="http://flywaydb.org/" target="_blank">Flyway</a>
